# Welcome

Step CI is an open-source API Quality Assurance framework

- **Language-agnostic**. Configure easily using YAML, JSON or JavaScript
- **REST, GraphQL, gRPC, tRPC, SOAP**. Test different API types in one workflow
- **Self-hosted**. Test services on your network, locally or with CI/CD
- **Integrated**. Play nicely with others
